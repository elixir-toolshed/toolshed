    * `dmesg/0`        - print kernel messages (Nerves-only)
    * `exit/0`         - exit out of an IEx session
    * `fw_validate/0`  - marks the current image as valid (check Nerves system if supported)
    * `grep/2`         - print out lines that match a regular expression
    * `hex/1`          - print a number as hex
    * `httpget/2`      - print or download the results of a HTTP GET request
    * `hostname/0`     - print our hostname
    * `ifconfig/0`     - print info on network interfaces

  Inspect a value with all integers printed out in hex. This is useful for
  one-off hex conversions. If you're doing a lot of work that requires
  hexadecimal output, you should consider running:

  `IEx.configure(inspect: [base: :hex])`

  The drawback of doing the above is that strings print out as hex binaries.
