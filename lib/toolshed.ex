  The following is a list of helpers:

    * `cat/1`          - print out a file
    * `cmd/1`          - run a system command and print the output
    * `date/0`         - print out the current date and time
    * `dmesg/0`        - print kernel messages (Nerves-only)
    * `exit/0`         - exit out of an IEx session
    * `fw_validate/0`  - marks the current image as valid (check Nerves system if supported)
    * `grep/2`         - print out lines that match a regular expression
    * `hex/1`          - print a number as hex
    * `history/0`      - print out the IEx shell history
    * `httpget/2`      - print or download the results of a HTTP GET request
    * `hostname/0`     - print our hostname
    * `ifconfig/0`     - print info on network interfaces
    * `load_term!/1`   - load a term that was saved by `save_term/2`
    * `log_attach/1`   - send log messages to the current group leader
    * `log_detach/0`   - stop sending log messages to the current group leader
    * `lsof/0`         - print out open file handles by OS process
    * `lsmod/0`        - print out what kernel modules have been loaded (Nerves-only)
    * `lsusb/0`        - print info on USB devices
    * `multicast_addresses/0` - print out all multicast addresses
    * `nslookup/1`     - query DNS to find an IP address
    * `ping/2`         - ping a remote host (but use TCP instead of ICMP)
    * `qr_encode/1`    - create a QR code (requires networking)
    * `reboot/0`       - reboots gracefully (Nerves-only)
    * `reboot!/0`      - reboots immediately  (Nerves-only)
    * `save_value/3`   - save a value to a file as Elixir terms (uses inspect)
    * `save_term!/2`   - save a term as a binary
    * `top/2`          - list out the top processes
    * `tping/2`        - check if a host can be reached (like ping, but uses TCP)
